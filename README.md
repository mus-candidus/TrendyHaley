# TrendyHaley
Mod for Stardew Valley which gives Haley a random hair color on the first day of a season.

Compatible with Cold Weather Haley for ContentPatcher by Nanogamer7 (https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/3091).

Configuration parameters in config.json:
HairColor - Haley's hair color for the season. Change it if you don't like the random value.
ColorIsFading - Sets whether Haley's hair color is fading to gray during the season. Default is true.
AlphaBlend - Use alpha blending for Haley's hair so she gets her original blonde back during the season.
SpouseLookAlike - Haley's spouse has the same hair color. Doesn't work exactly if AlphaBlend is true since the farmer sprite doesn't have a hair texture for blending.
